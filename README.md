# ML644
Information about the ML644, a CP/M-80 machine built and used by Utah State University

If you were a EE student at Utah State University in the early '80s, you most likely used an ML644. These machines were used by students in the EE lab and for general purpose computing all around the university.

There were two basic ML644 configurations:

* The lab configuration. These machines were installed in pairs in large boxes. There were two 8" floppy drives, one connected to each machine. On the back, there were six serial ports, three connected to each machine.
* The general-purpose configuration. These were also installed in large boxes, but as a single machine. The two 8" floppy drives were connected to the single machine present in the box. On the back, there were only three serial ports, connected to the single machine in the box.

At some point, these machines were commercialized by an outfit in Salt Lake City called something like MicrOmega; their logo consisted of the Greek letters mu and omega. These folks put the machines in a half-height box, using a pair of half-height Tandon 8" drives instead of the full-height Shugarts used by Utah State University.

Features of the ML644 are:

* 4-MHz Z80.
* 64k bytes of dynamic ram.
* Three serial ports operating at 600, 1200, 9600, or 19200 baud.
* A Z80 CTC for counter and timer tasks.
* A Z80 PIO to do things like select baud rates and floppy drives as well as enable or disable the EPROMs.
* A WD1771 floppy controller to handle up to four 8" single-sided single-density drives.
* Up to four 2716 EPROMs.
* Four expansion connectors. The only expansion card I've ever seen in one of these was a double-density floppy controller in a MicrOmega system.

There is also a related system, called Pixie, that runs at 2MHz and has only 32k bytes of RAM.
